# Advent Of Code 2024
I tried my best to make this as clean as possible for readability:
1. There is a single "driver" file that is the starting point for all the code
2. All helper files are located in supporting_functions, this are pieces of code I figured would be reused over and over again
3. The core code code for each day is located in the days folder
4. Each input needed for a specific day is located in the inputs folder

I have done my absolute best to comment everything in depth so if anyone is reading it (aka you, whom ever you may be mysterious reader) can use this a learning tool

*This code is also far from perfect, it works and are just the solutions that first came to mind when reading each problem. I am sure they could be solved fast and with less code, so feel free to tweak anything and everything you find in this project!!*
